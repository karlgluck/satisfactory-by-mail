## Day 1: Planetfall
*Ficsir K*

In its infinite wisdom, Ficsit selected the rolling hills of the plains on which to dump me and my Biologically Relevant Other (BROther, or BRO for short). While he recuperates from reentry, I've been running around selecting a location for our company's newest venture. And punching space goats.

## Day 2: Slow and steady
*Ficsir E*

My Ficsit-assigned Biological Efficiency Catalyst (a.k.a. coworker) had already set up a mining operation before I woke from my sleep pod. What a guy! Not one to carry ore by hand, I did some digging in the research archives and found a miner blueprint. The ore around here is full of contaminates, so it won't mine that quickly, but there's plenty of space to find more ore patches if these don't sustain us.

*Iron rod and iron plate - Corporate didn't include plans for splitters, so we're running at half efficiency*

## Day 3: With great chainsaws comes great power
*Ficsir E*

The miners are great, but they eat up all our power! I turned from ore-carryer to leaf-picker. Luckily I found an old diagram of a chainsaw tucked in the void of the storage box - last guy must've snuck that in here for me. Thanks to him the plains are sunny and the generators are full of burnables. Hope the locals don't mind a little smoke!

## Day 4: A bridge to nowhere
*Ficsir E*

These space-alloys are great! I started building out over the bottomless pit we're next to just to see how far I could get before the structure gave way - turns out, I built a bridge. With foundations this strong we might as well lay our factory over the void - flat space with no impact on the local environment? Yes please.

![ConcreteWellSpent](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190326-11390700000.png?raw=true "Concrete well spent")
*Ficsit went all out on these metal boxes - I wonder what's really inside*

## Day 5: Observe and report
*Ficsir K*

I woke up from my nap near the copper mine to find that the BRO set up a great layout while I was away! I'm amazed at how well our factory floats over the abyss. I was wary at first to step out on to the factory floor, but with all that steel already out there my weight surely wouldn't be the difference to make it fall.

I spent most of the day running around figuring out how everything was connected and gathering the parts necessary for a space elevator. There are now beacons at a couple of the important locations, too!

*Wouldn't want to be up there in a storm*

## Day 6: Rotors and RIP
*Ficsir K*

The Space Elevator has been constructed and work is in progress to construct and deliver the requested supplies to the orbital Ficsit platform. Our team deployed the first Assemblers to the factory floor geared toward the production of Rotors and Reinforced Iron Plate. Sadly, our current conveyor belts are unable to deliver screws at a fast enough rate to maximize efficiency of the assemblers. Perhaps Ficsit will provide us with an upgrade in the future?

## Day 7: Power outages, coal, and angry beasts
*Ficsir K*

I worked a little overtime today in order to deal with the rolling power outages caused by the installation of our new assemblers. I chainsawed enough trees over the hill to bring all the biomass burners back online, but in doing so royally ticked off the local fauna. Also, I found this glowing rock?

![CoolRock](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190326-19551800000.png?raw=true "Only cool kids can draw this rock")
*This reminds me of being a kid for some reason*

After recovering from my scrape with a few Paleberries, I decided to find an alternate fuel source. Good thing we've got this handy coal scanner!

Using true Ficsit ingenuity, I have built a way to the coal out of platforms that crosses high above the misty abyss. A "high-way" if you will. When complete, it will enough space for two tractors carrying coal to traverse opposite directions simultaneously but I need to source additional concrete to complete the job.

## Day 8: Symmetry
*Ficsir E*

I had a dream about butterflies - something about this place speaks to my symmetric side. I brought that idea to the factory today, and re-arranged our plant to optimize for RIPs. Six assemblers brought online in a butterfly arrangement! The only problem is we don't have the power (or the iron) to feed them all.

Didn't Ficsir K say something about finding coal? I'll have to go check on that...

![SymmetricRIPping](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190327-18590100000.png?raw=true "Symmetry is beautiful")
*RIP*

## Day 9: Time to get truckin'
*Ficsir K*

The butterfly RIPs look great! Our factory is probably going to end up with modules that develop each material and using trucks to pull ingredients between them. I can see it now... trucks everywhere!

And as if Ficsit hadn't given us enough to do already, now they want us to make steel. Well, fine. Coal is on its way. Only problem is... our automated trucks may not exactly follow their preassigned paths. I fully expect one to fly off into the abyss any moment now...

![GoGoGadgetTruck](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190327-13022500000.png?raw=true "Go go gadget truck!")
*Waves goodbye to truck*

## Day 10: Alternate Reality
*Ficsir E*

Woah. I had kept seeing fleeting images of trucks driving by with coal as I was laying down some new power plants. It gave me a headache so I went and automated iron delivery... but when I came back, it was gone. Something is messing with the timeline on this planet - I'll have to keep an eye on that.

![TruckingAround](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190327-21222200000.png?raw=true "Trucking around")

## Day 11: Going Vertical
*Ficsir E*

Headquarters keeps telling me I should be "raising the bar" and "looking higher" and "climbing the ladder"... I get the hint. The space elevator is the highest thing around, so I've started building vertical next to it! With lots of layers it will look like a nice lasagna.

Also watch your step up there, I think I sprained my ankle from a fall earlier. Maybe we need jelly-pads under the ladders for safety.

![WonkyBelts](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190328-20513900000.png?raw=true "Don't look at the belts!")

## Day 12: Up up and away!
*Ficsir K*

Our factory tower has grown a new level exclusively for the production of Reinforced Iron Plate. While the pattern used is less pretty than the butterfly, this fit the layout and produces a solid 10 RIPs per minute with minimal wasted production capacity. Unfortunately, there are now 3 truck stops in need of iron ingots and no automation. I wonder how Ficsit planned for us to handle the automated traffic jam we're about to cause. These self-driving trucks are finnicky at best.

![Rippyrip](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190330-10390700000.png?raw=true "Ah, the smell of fresh RIPs in the morning!")

## Day 13: Such great heights
*Ficsir E*

*sniffs* Aaaahhh. A fine day to re-factor(y). The beltways now once again obey the laws of physics, and I set about resetting the navigation on the trucks. Copper, iron, and coal are all automated.. hopefully they don't crash into eachother. Already had to dig one out of the space-alloy foundation (how it warped in, I don't know. I think there is dark matter inside..)

![AllTheOutputs](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190331-19040100000.png?raw=true "All the little output boxes, sitting in a row")

## Day 14: Asleep at the wheel
*Ficsir K*

Phew, I must have been dead asleep and dreaming hard because when I woke up it seemed like the whole world had moved... something about locals... app data... it's gone now. Anyway, the tower grows ever upwards and now sports a brand new layer cranking out 12 rotors/minute!

We are almost capped in progress without the next Space Elevator upgrade, and so the next step is a steel ingot plant. Probably going to put that somewhere nearby--maybe on the backside of the coal power plants--and conveyor the results to go up the tower alongside our current resources. I sure hope we don't run into any structural issues building so high!

![AWholeNewWorld](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190406-09244500000.png?raw=true "A whole new row of possibilities!")
![TheTowerGrows](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190331-10284600000.png?raw=true "The tower grows ever upward")

## Day 15: Rethinking conveyer belts
*Ficsir E*

We use a lot of belts. Adding a new level takes a lot of time... so I rethought how the resource delivery system worked in order to save time and boost our vertical (and thereby research) progress. Unfortunately, this required another restructure of the framework..

Our factory now runs on pure ores, no longer smelted ingots. This requires more room on the factory floor, but allows single delivery of iron ore for both iron ingots and smelting steel - which has been implemented to great success.

With the second Space Elevator upgrade complete and a new set of faster belts researched (Mk. 3!) I'm looking forward to some new upgrades - corporate said I may get a new set of boots!

![TowerOfPower](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190407-17474800000.png?raw=true "Looking like a real tower of power")

## Day 16: Concrete jungle
*Ficsir K*

Another day, another milestone...or three! I'm sure my B.R.O. will be happy to find that there is a brand spankin' new pair of jumpy-legs in the personal storage chest next to the HUB!

 Unfortunately, oil is more that 2 klicks away across some water. I may have tried taking a Sugar Cube out there to scout and ended up running off a cliff into space bees.

 ![SugarCubeBurnsRubber](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190410-07134000000.png?raw=true "What? I'm thinking!")
 
 On top of that, the Caterium right next to our base is entirely covered by an immovable boulder! Figures Ficsit wouldn't send us with dynamite or anything.

 My big accomplishment for today, though? Burning through thousands of concrete to expand our factory floor to maximum dimensions!

 ![ConcreteJungle](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190410-07072600000.png?raw=true "Ah, the smell of cement and diesel in the morning")

 After much ado and consideration while deconstructing the remnants of our previous tower's conveyor system, I want to try an adjacent 3D bus system inspired by some schematics I found for microchips on the Ficsinternet.

 ![BusIdea](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190410-07540500000.png?raw=true "Let's get bussy!")

 There are some very specific rules about how this construct aligns to the factory floor. Splitters and mergers, for example, are always in the center of floor tiles. Since splitters can't be stacked, adding a new layer of capacity to a belt requires removing all conveyors in that stack and those immediately adjacent, then rebuilding all splitters in that stack from top to bottom.

 The idea would be that the production capacity expands orthogonally from the bus to meet demand, and belts expand vertically to grow their capacity. From our Ficsit field guide, it appears we would need about 32 columns. My intent is to start the construction as far back as possible facing our current factory, and create a "delivery floor" under the current floor for suppliers to drop raw materials at truck stops underneath that get conveyed up to the start of the bus. 
 
 Perhaps after a brief nap I'll continue this endeavor...
