A handy [construction reference manual](https://i.redd.it/qatwxlpgdio21.jpg)


## Day 1: Planetfall
*Ficsir K*

In its infinite wisdom, Ficsit selected the rolling hills of the plains on which to dump me and my Biologically Relevant Other (BROther, or BRO for short). While he recuperates from reentry, I've been running around selecting a location for our company's newest venture. And punching space goats.

## Day 2: Slow and steady
*Ficsir E*

My Ficsit-assigned Biological Efficiency Catalyst (a.k.a. coworker) had already set up a mining operation before I woke from my sleep pod. What a guy! Not one to carry ore by hand, I did some digging in the research archives and found a miner blueprint. The ore around here is full of contaminates, so it won't mine that quickly, but there's plenty of space to find more ore patches if these don't sustain us.

*Iron rod and iron plate - Corporate didn't include plans for splitters, so we're running at half efficiency*

## Day 3: With great chainsaws comes great power
*Ficsir E*

The miners are great, but they eat up all our power! I turned from ore-carryer to leaf-picker. Luckily I found an old diagram of a chainsaw tucked in the void of the storage box - last guy must've snuck that in here for me. Thanks to him the plains are sunny and the generators are full of burnables. Hope the locals don't mind a little smoke!

*The carbon tax on this place is going to get expensive*

## Day 4: A bridge to nowhere
*Ficsir E*

These space-alloys are great! I started building out over the bottomless pit we're next to just to see how far I could get before the structure gave way - turns out, I built a bridge. With foundations this strong we might as well lay our factory over the void - flat space with no impact on the local environment? Yes please.

![ConcreteWellSpent](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190326-11390700000.png?raw=true "Concrete well spent")
*Ficsit went all out on these metal boxes - I wonder what's really inside*

## Day 5: Observe and report
*Ficsir K*

I woke up from my nap near the copper mine to find that the BRO set up a great layout while I was away! I'm amazed at how well our factory floats over the abyss. I was wary at first to step out on to the factory floor, but with all that steel already out there my weight surely wouldn't be the difference to make it fall.

I spent most of the day running around figuring out how everything was connected and gathering the parts necessary for a space elevator. There are now beacons at a couple of the important locations, too!

*Wouldn't want to be up there in a storm*

## Day 6: Rotors and RIP
*Ficsir K*

The Space Elevator has been constructed and work is in progress to construct and deliver the requested supplies to the orbital Ficsit platform. Our team deployed the first Assemblers to the factory floor geared toward the production of Rotors and Reinforced Iron Plate. Sadly, our current conveyor belts are unable to deliver screws at a fast enough rate to maximize efficiency of the assemblers. Perhaps Ficsit will provide us with an upgrade in the future?

## Day 7: Power outages, coal, and angry beasts
*Ficsir K*

I worked a little overtime today in order to deal with the rolling power outages caused by the installation of our new assemblers. I chainsawed enough trees over the hill to bring all the biomass burners back online, but in doing so royally ticked off the local fauna. Also, I found this glowing rock?

![CoolRock](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190326-19551800000.png?raw=true "Only cool kids can draw this rock")
*This reminds me of being a kid for some reason*

After recovering from my scrape with a few Paleberries, I decided to find an alternate fuel source. Good thing we've got this handy coal scanner!

Using true Ficsit ingenuity, I have built a way to the coal out of platforms that crosses high above the misty abyss. A "high-way" if you will. When complete, it will enough space for two tractors carrying coal to traverse opposite directions simultaneously but I need to source additional concrete to complete the job.

*What is "drifting"?*

## Day 8: Symmetry
*Ficsir E*

I had a dream about butterflies - something about this place speaks to my symmetric side. I brought that idea to the factory today, and re-arranged our plant to optimize for RIPs. Six assemblers brought online in a butterfly arrangement! The only problem is we don't have the power (or the iron) to feed them all.

Didn't Ficsir K say something about finding coal? I'll have to go check on that...

![SymmetricRIPping](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190327-18590100000.png?raw=true "Symmetry is beautiful")
*RIP*

## Day 9: Time to get truckin'
*Ficsir K*

The butterfly RIPs look great! Our factory is probably going to end up with modules that develop each material and using trucks to pull ingredients between them. I can see it now... trucks everywhere!

And as if Ficsit hadn't given us enough to do already, now they want us to make steel. Well, fine. Coal is on its way. Only problem is... our automated trucks may not exactly follow their preassigned paths. I fully expect one to fly off into the abyss any moment now...

![GoGoGadgetTruck](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190327-13022500000.png?raw=true "Go go gadget truck!")
*Waves goodbye to truck*

## Day 10: Alternate Reality
*Ficsir E*

Woah. I had kept seeing fleeting images of trucks driving by with coal as I was laying down some new power plants. It gave me a headache so I went and automated iron delivery... but when I came back, it was gone. Something is messing with the timeline on this planet - I'll have to keep an eye on that.

## Day 10: Going Vertical
*Ficsir E*

Headquarters keeps telling me I should be "raising the bar" and "looking higher" and "climbing the ladder"... I get the hint. The space elevator is the highest thing around, so I've started building vertical next to it! With lots of layers it will look like a nice lasagna.

Also watch your step up there, I think I sprained my ankle from a fall earlier. Maybe we need jelly-pads under the ladders for safety.

![WonkyBelts](/Screenshots/Screenshot20190328-20513900000.png?raw=true "Don't look at the belts!")

## Day 11: Going
*Ficsir K*

Our factory tower has grown a new level exclusively for the production of Reinforced Iron Plate. While the pattern used is less pretty than the butterfly, this fit the layout and produces a solid 10 RIPs per minute with minimal wasted production capacity. Unfortunately, there are now 3 truck stops in need of iron ingots and no automation. I wonder how Ficsit planned for us to handle the automated traffic jam we're about to cause. These self-driving trucks are finnicky at best.
