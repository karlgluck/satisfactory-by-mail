A handy [construction reference manual](https://i.redd.it/qatwxlpgdio21.jpg)


## Day 1: Planetfall
*Operator K*

In its infinite wisdom, Ficsit selected the rolling hills of the plains on which to dump me and my Biologically Relevant Other (BROther, or BRO for short). While he recuperates from reentry, I've been running around selecting a location for our company's newest venture. And punching space goats.

## Day 2: Slow and steady
*Operator E*

My Ficsit-assigned Biological Efficiency Catalyst (a.k.a. coworker) had already set up a mining operation before I woke from my sleep pod. What a guy! Not one to carry ore by hand, I did some digging in the research archives and found a miner blueprint. The ore around here is full of contaminates, so it won't mine that quickly, but there's plenty of space to find more ore patches if these don't sustain us.

*Iron rod and iron plate - Corporate didn't include plans for splitters, so we're running at half efficiency*

## Day 3: With great chainsaws comes great power
*Operator E*

The miners are great, but they eat up all our power! I turned from ore-carryer to leaf-picker. Luckily I found an old diagram of a chainsaw tucked in the void of the storage box - last guy must've snuck that in here for me. Thanks to him the plains are sunny and the generators are full of burnables. Hope the locals don't mind a little smoke!

## Day 4: A bridge to nowhere
*Operator E*

These space-alloys are great! I started building out over the bottomless pit we're next to just to see how far I could get before the structure gave way - turns out, I built a bridge. With foundations this strong we might as well lay our factory over the void - flat space with no impact on the local environment? Yes please.

*Ficsit went all out on these metal boxes - I wonder what's really inside*

## Day 5: Observe and report
*Operator K*

I woke up from my nap near the copper mine to find that the BRO set up a great layout while I was away! I'm amazed at how well our factory floats over the abyss. I was wary at first to step out on to the factory floor, but with all that steel already out there my weight surely wouldn't be the difference to make it fall.

I spent most of the day running around figuring out how everything was connected and gathering the parts necessary for a space elevator. There are now beacons at a couple of the important locations, too!

*Wouldn't want to be up there in a storm*

## Day 6: Rotors and RIP
*Operator K*

The Space Elevator has been constructed and work is in progress to construct and deliver the requested supplies to the orbital Ficsit platform. Our team deployed the first Assemblers to the factory floor geared toward the production of Rotors and Reinforced Iron Plate. Sadly, our current conveyor belts are unable to deliver screws at a fast enough rate to maximize efficiency of the assemblers. Perhaps Ficsit will provide us with an upgrade in the future?
