## Day 4: A bridge to nowhere

These space-alloys are great! I started building out over the bottomless pit we're next to just to see how far I could get before the structure gave way - turns out, I built a bridge. With foundations this strong we might as well lay our factory over the void - flat space with no impact on the local environment? Yes please.

*Ficsit went all out on these metal boxes - I wonder what's really inside*

## Day 3: With great chainsaws comes great power

The miners are great, but they eat up all our power! I turned from ore-carryer to leaf-picker. Luckily I found an old diagram of a chainsaw tucked in the void of the storage box - last guy must've snuck that in here for me. Thanks to him the plains are sunny and the generators are full of burnables. Hope the locals don't mind a little smoke!

## Day 2: Slow and steady

My Ficsit-assigned Biological Efficiency Catalyst (a.k.a. coworker) had already set up a mining operation before I woke from my sleep pod. What a guy! Not one to carry ore by hand, I did some digging in the research archives and found a miner blueprint. The ore around here is full of contaminates, so it won't mine that quickly, but there's plenty of space to find more ore patches if these don't sustain us.

*Iron rod and iron plate - Corporate didn't include plans for splitters, so we're running at half efficiency*
